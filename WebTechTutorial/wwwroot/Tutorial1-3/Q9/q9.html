	<h1>Product name: Jaguar's I-Pace Electric SUV</h1>

	<h3>Feature: </h3>
	<p>I’M 40 FEET from the Jaguar, mint chocolate chip ice cream dripping down the cone onto my fingers, when I hear the purring from under the hood. Strange, I think. First off, the car is parked. Second, it doesn’t have an engine. It’s only after a moment that I realize the sound is the car defending itself against the brutality of a summer day in Southern California’s Coachella Valley. The fast charger I’ve plugged into the car is ramming in electrons, heating up the battery pack. Add 100-degree weather on top of that, and you see why the fan is running at full pelt. It’s making sure the I-Pace, Jaguar’s first all-electric car and a serious challenger to Tesla’s EV dominance, remains a cool cat.</p>

	<h1>Product name: Mercedes-Benz Hypercar, NHTSA</h1>
	<img src="pr2.jpg">
	<h3>Feature: </h3>
	<p>AFTER YEARS OF hearings, investigations, and states doing whatever they like in the absence of federal decision-making, self-driving car decrees flowed out of Washington, DC, this week like your data from Equifax.

The Department of Transportation updated its policy on automated vehicles. The National Transportation Safety Board released the results of a yearlong investigation into a deadly Tesla Autopilot crash. The Senate took on self-driving trucks, with a hearing that pitted the industry against the truckers who ply the nation's highways. Transportation change is happening, and this country’s policymakers finally seem ready to tackle it.</p>

<div id="product3">
	<h1 >Product name: Audi's 815-horsepower</h1>
	<img src="pr3.jpg">
	<h3>Feature: </h3>
	<p>The Vision Gran Turismo program is a simple, wonderful idea that churns out striking concepts like clockwork. Automakers design over-the-top performance cars to be included in the Gran Turismo video game, and then, like Dr. Frankenstein, they succumb to the irresistible desire to bring their creations to life. Audi is now the latest automaker to bite with its new e-tron Vision Gran Turismo concept.

The e-tron concept doesn’t look all that different from a modern GT racer, even while it’s adorned with Audi’s hot orange accents. But its performance specs are something to behold. Two 200kW motors on the rear axle and one on the front give it all-wheel drive and a total power output of 600kW, which is roughly equivalent to 815 horsepower. The car weighs just over 3,000 pounds, which — combined with all that power — means it can get from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.4 seconds.</p>
